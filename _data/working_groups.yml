  - name: Open Science Infrastructure
    coordinator: "[Craig Willis](mailto:willis8@illinois.edu)"
    status: Proposed
    description: The proposed  working group will bring together representatives from key open science infrastructure projects related to computational reproducibility and publishing of composite research objects (e.g., code, data, and environment) to improve interoperability and maximize system utility for researchers.

  - name: Materials Science
    coordinator: "[Ben Blaiszik](blaiszik@uchicago.edu), [Kyle Chard](chard@uchicago.edu)"
    status: Active
    description: The materials science working group focuses on the pragmatic aspects of sharing and publishing materials science data and analysis processes. The group will bring together materials scientists, computer scientists, repository owners, publishers, and others that are interested in the challenges, technologies, and approaches associated with computational materials science. The group is particularly focused on methods to publish data and analysis processes in ways that are easily sharable and reproducible. Thus, the group will cover aspects such as data management, analysis, computational modalities, curation, persistent identifiers, citation, reproducibility, distribution, archival, etc.
