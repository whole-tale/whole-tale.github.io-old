  - name: Santiago Núñez-Corrales
    title: Doctoral Student, University of Illinois
    bio: Santiago is a PhD candidate in the Informatics program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and an ACM SIGHPC/Intel Computational and Data Science Fellow (2017), with a minor in Global Studies. He obtained a B.S, in Computer Engineering from the Costa Rica Institute of Technology. His current research involves understanding complex multiscale stochastic systems - systems with irreducible noise that can be described at multiple scales and are thermodynamically irreversible- by focusing on interactions rather than dynamics or trajectories through stochastic methods, and developing mathematical physics theory and cyberinfrastructure embodying principles derived from this view. At present, Núñez-Corrales is the Outreach Coordinator for the Open Storage Network, an NSF-funded initiative that aims at creating a nation-scale distributed research data storage cyberinfrastructure layer.

  - name: Christina Ore
    title: Doctor of Public Health, University of Arizona
    bio: Christina Ore is dedicated to community, inter-generational health and well-being that comes from a deep connection to place, people, and memory. Born and raised in southwestern Arizona, she is Quechua-mestizo (Peru) and Irish (US). Christina has nearly 20 years of experience as a public health practitioner working for Indigenous communities, tribal governments and national/ regional tribal organizations in U.S., Guam, and Mexico. In 2018, Christina received her DrPH from the University of Arizona (UA), Zuckerman College of Public Health, in policy and management. Her dissertation centered and privileged Indigenous knowledge to re frame public health practice. Christina's multidisciplinary minor included coursework from the UA, Rogers College of Law, Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy Program (IPLP) and UA, Sociology Department. Christina is currently a Senior Analyst with the Pascua Yaqui Tribe’s Health Services Division (PYHSD). She works on system improvement initiatives related to self-governance, integration, and public health accreditation. She is founding member of the UA American Indian Indigenous Health Alliance (AIIHA), member of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association (NAISA) and US Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network (USIDSN). Christina lives in Tucson, Arizona with her husband, two children, and extended family, including her father.

  - name: Hyoungjoo Park,
    bio: Hyoungjoo Park is a PhD candidate in the School of Information Studies at the University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee. Hyoungjoo’s dissertation examined the impact of research data sharing and reuse on data citation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. In her dissertation, Hyoungjoo examined the interdisciplinary data citation, data self-citation, data type, disciplinary differences, data sharing. As a data fellow, Hyoungjoo will examine data citation by comparatively analyzing Event Data Index and Data Citation Index.

  - name: Ashirwad Barnwal
    title: Doctoral Student, Iowa State University
    bio: Ashirwad Barnwal is a second year PhD student in the Department of Civil Engineering and a first year master’s student in the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University. He graduated with a master’s degree in civil engineering from Iowa State in the summer of 2017 and later joined the research group of Dr. Anuj Sharma to work in the area of transportation data analytics. For the last one year, he has been working on developing a data visualization tool to help Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) streamline their winter maintenance efforts. More recently, he became part of the intersection analysis project sponsored by the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) to model the impact of cognitive decline in elderly people on their decision making at the yellow light dilemma zones. As a WT-RDA/US fellow, he will explore the ways to popularize the tools and technologies that facilitate reproducible research.
