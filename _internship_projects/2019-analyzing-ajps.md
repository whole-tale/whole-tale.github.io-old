# Analysis of Verified Replication Packages from the American Journal for Political Science

## Project Description

Since 2015, the American Journal for Political Science (AJPS) has adopted a
Replication and Verification Policy (https://ajps.org/ajps-replication-policy/)
that requires researchers to deposit replication materials (including data and
code) required to reproduce analytic results reported in published articles. In
cooperation with the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, AJPS has
implemented a process for third-party verification. Replication packages
deposited since the adoption of this policy should have a higher success rate
for computational reproducibility than packages that were not verified.

This internship will explore the rates of reproducibility for packages submitted
before and after the policy adoption and implementation of the Odum workflow.
Results should be comparable to those reported by Kingi et al for the American
Economic Journal. The intern will download a subset of packages from the AJPS
Dataverse and attempt to reproduce the reported results (with reasonable effort)
using the Whole Tale platform, when possible.


## Necessary Prerequisites:
 * Basic understanding of quantitative methods in political science
 * Ability to run and troubleshoot code in a variety of languages (R, Python, Matlab, Stata)
 * Basic programming skills including the ability to download and process published data packages

## Desirable Skills / Qualifications:
 * Interest in data curation
 * Interest in open, reproducible science and computational reproducibility

## Expected Outcomes:
 * Assessment report on issues encountered during replication attempts (e.g., computing systems, data, code, documentation quality)
 * A set of tales in WT representing the AJPS replication packages
 * Requirements for the Whole Tale system for unsupported replication packages

**Primary Mentor**: Craig Willis, National Center for Supercomputing Application, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
