Working Groups
==============

The Whole Tale project has been designed with a strong focus on user engagement, both to guide development activities through regular and rapid feedback and to disseminate WT capabilities and tools through different science communities. To provide the greatest value both to the communities they represent and to the WT project, working groups are dynamic in nature and their focus and membership can evolve over the course of the project.


## Joining an existing working group

See the list of [active and proposed working groups](current_working_groups.html) for status, activity, and contact information. To join an active working group, contact the current chair or feel free to reach out to us at <mailto:info@wholetale.org>.


## Proposing a new working group

We welcome proposals for new working groups.  If you are comfortable with Github, [submit an issue](https://github.com/whole-tale/whole-tale/issues/new) describing your proposed working group or feel free to email a proposal to <mailto:info@wholetale.org>. 

## Working group guidelines

Working groups should contain representatives from different communities with a strong focus on encouraging membership from communities that are investigating or already developing technologies and approaches that are well aligned with the WT vision.

The most important goals of the working groups are to: 
* Provide rapid feedback to WT about tool and CI development
* Help in the development and dissemination of community pilots and technical archetypes
* Evaluate and develop small demos or prototypes to provide feedback on WT directions

Working group activities may include:
* Identification of CI challenges seen in their domains
* Definition of use cases 
* Providing feedback on prioritization
* Identification of external systems for WT integration 
* Evaluation and design or prototype WT capabilities
* Provision of feedback and guidance on WT progress
* Outreach to the wider community (e.g., via conference participation and informal interactions with others)

While working groups will be given autonomy, we suggest the following structure:
* Leadership should identify timely deliverables, such as reports, use cases, or tool prototypes
* Communication via monthly conference calls, mailing list, chat, and wiki

Whole Tale will provide the following:
* Liaison for note taking and publishing meeting minutes
* Communication channels and collaborative spaces
