## Dates: September 13-14, 2018 
## Location: Big Ten Center, Chicago

Do you conduct computational research that you want to make more accessible?  Do you want to learn about exploring and building upon research and data produced elsewhere?  

Then consider joining us at the first Whole Tale Workshop on Tools and Approaches for Publishing Reproducible Research at the Big Ten Center in Chicago (near O’Hare) to discuss initiatives to conduct, track, remix, and share your research. We’re bringing together domain scientists, computer scientists, and infrastructure developers to discuss and implement use cases related to how to improve the process of conducting research and scholarship in the modern era.  We are specifically interested in understanding how Whole Tale infrastructure, tools, and services make your workflows easier, and more reproducible.

This is an open invitation to participate, but space is limited so please apply early.  We particularly invite participation and contributions from domains related to current Whole Tale working groups such as Material Science, Archaeology and Ecology, Astronomy, and Computational Social Science. The Whole Tale project team will be in attendance, sharing their ideas and working with participants to set goals and guide development of the project moving forward.  Attendees will also have the opportunity to learn to use Whole Tale to share research results with their peers, publishers, and funders, and will have the opportunity to work with Whole Tale team members to build out tools that take advantage of the Whole Tale platform to better showcase their work.

Whole Tale is an NSF-funded project (wholetale.org) that aims to address the barriers to sharing scientific knowledge by connecting computational, data-intensive research efforts with the larger research process—transforming the knowledge discovery and dissemination process into one where data products are united with research articles to create ‘‘living publications’’ or tales. 

Whether you’re an expert in reproducible research, or a complete novice who is intrigued, a researcher in a related project, or if you just want to do neat things to explore showcasing your research results in a new way, we’d love to see you in Chicago this Fall!

## Format

 * Whole Tale Overview -- what is Whole Tale and how can I use it? 
 * Lightning talks -- what cool things are people doing to address reproducibility (e.g., with Whole Tale or related technologies)?
 * End-to-end use case demonstrations -- cradle to grave demonstrations of conducting reproducible research
 * Hands-on breakout sessions -- get your data, tools or workflows into Whole Tale and share with the world!
 * User experience sessions -- tell us what is easy, hard, and can be improved about the Whole Tale environment

The Workshop features an overview and introduction to Whole Tale, lightning talks, demonstrations, and hands-on breakouts related to tools for sharing scientific results that promote open science, science reproducibility and re-use.

## Lightning talks

We want participants to have an opportunity to share their enthusiasm and inspiration! The workshop lightning talks provide a great opportunity to speak about your experiences, opinions or ideas relating to reproducible research tools. They can be used to generate inspiration, discussion and participation in other sessions at the workshop, breakout sessions and even just in the coffee breaks. All accepted lightning talks will be eligible for travel support.

## Travel Support

Participants from academia can apply for travel support, which includes 2 nights of lodging and transport (estimated at $400, depending on actual cost and availability of funds).  Priority will be given to those presenting Lightning Talks. 

## Important Dates

* Lightning talk (tentative title + optional abstract): 10 August 2018  
* Lighting talk decisions: 15 August, 2018
* Travel support requests: 17 August, 2018 
* Decisions on travel support announced: 22 August, 2018
* Final lightning talk abstracts: 7 Sept 2018
