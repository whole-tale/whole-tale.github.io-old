## Whole Tale Dashboard

The Whole Tale environment is completely free and open for use.  

[Try it out now](https://dashboard.wholetale.org/) -- but be aware, it's still
in alpha and might not quite work like you (or we) expect!

## Working groups

Whole Tale is focused on addressing real scientific use cases. For this purpose we host a number of science and cyberinfrastructure working groups.

Science working groups focus on discussing current challenges in materials science, biology, astrophysics, environmental science, and social sciences.  Topics tackled by these working groups interest include data management, reproducibility, publication, and analysis frontends.  

Cyberinfrastructure and engagement working groups focus on challenges associated with provenance and reproducibility, education, and interacting with publishers.

[Contact us](mailto:info@wholetale.org) to join or form a working group.

## Internships

Each year we host interns to explore different aspects of the project, from
science-focused internships using the Whole Tale platform through to
internships focused on development of the platform. Internships are conducted
over a 10-week period and include a research stipend. Interns are paired with
one or more mentors who are associated with the project.

In 2017 we had more than 80 applicants and accepted three interns.

These internships focused on reproducing machine learning models used to
predict materials properties;  tracking the provenance of paleoclimate
reconstruction workflows; and understanding the requirements on infrastructure
to promote reproducible research.

## Workshops

Workshops provide an opportunity for hands-on use and extension of the Whole
Tale platform.  Workshops focus not only on science domains but also
integration of the platform with data and compute sources, publishers, and
external cyberinfrastructure providers. 

In 2017 we hosted our first workshop in collaboration with DataONE. The
workshop allowed more than 20 researchers from Archaeology, Environmental
Science, and Computer Science  to build reproducible workflows and investigate
a wide range of approaches to capture provenance in RStudio environments.  Information 
about the workshop is [available online](https://github.com/DataONEorg/provathon-2017).

The upcoming [Workshop on Tools and Approaches for Publishing Reproducible
Research](/2018/06/26/working-group-workshop.html) will be held September
13-14, 2018.
