title: Using Whole Tale
---

## Welcome to Whole Tale!

Over the next couple slides, we'll show how you might interact with Whole Tale
to explore published research.

---

When you first visit [Whole Tale](https://dashboard.wholetale.org/), you'll
need to log in with your credentials -- you can use just about any identity
provider, like your university credentials or Google!

Next, you'll be shown some Tales that are already on the system.  These are
combinations of data and execution environment.

At the bottom of each Tale there's a "Launch" button.  Let's launch the LIGO
Tale.  This creates a new, running instance of this Tale that we can experiment
with.

---

Once the compute engine has been initialized, click on the "LIGO Tutorial" in the "Launched Tales" panel. This will take you to the compute environment -- in this case, [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

---

When you're inside a Tale, you'll be inside some working directory containing: 
`home` (your very own persistent home directory) and `data`.

<!-- .slide: class="captioned" data-background-image="assets/images/slideshow/ss05_jupyter.png" data-background-position="center top 0.5em" data-background-size="auto 75%" -->

---

Under `data` are all the data files -- local *or* remote -- associated with the
Tale you're visiting.  Let's visit the notebook.

<!-- .slide: class="captioned" data-background-image="assets/images/slideshow/ss06_jupyter_subfolder.png" data-background-position="center top 0.5em" data-background-size="auto 75%" -->

---

Once we've visited the notebook, we have a fully-capable, data-filled
environment!  Plus, we can generate *new* data that we can package into our own
Tale.

Thanks for checking out Whole Tale!
